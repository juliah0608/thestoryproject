  <h3> If you're reading this, it means you're on my laptop. You're probably an investigator or officer trying to figure out where I've up and dissapeared off to. Congratualtions on even finding this page, by the way. This site was pretty well hidden from most of my friends and family--if I can even call them that. To be honest I don't really know who truly "likes" me anymore. None of them show any interest in me beyond superficialiities. It's like lunch at Balthazar, shopping at Saks, and doing the occasional line of coke at Lola is all we really do with our time anymore. Well the coke's not too bad, but you see what I mean. This world is corrupt dear reader--corrupt and bent on greed and consumption and materialism. It's why I had to get away, HAD to get out of here. I needed to cleanse myself of my sins, needed to indulge in my true nature. That's when I found out about The Society. It's like, for the first time in my life, I wasn't being judged on how many designer pieces I had, or the number of followers I had on my Instagram account. The members didn't care about that, they didn't care about any of my material items. They just cared about what was within, and boy did I unleash a lot in those early sessions at the cemetary. It's like, I've been living with all this RAGE, all these PRIMAL urges. That's why I had to leave, why I had to go back to where it all began. I had to see HIM. I just had to. It's going to set me free. But in true influencer fashion, I'm going out with a bang. It would be totally out of character if this all didn't have some juicy story attached!! So, here's what you've probably been waiting for: some clues. Well, I invite you to explore this little game I've created in my spare time (had to show off my cool coding skills so you don't paint me to be some dumb NYC Socialite who went missing----go women in STEM!!). Each link leads to a clue, but not every clue leads to another. It's up to you to figure out which link is the starting point, and from the page your taken to, figure out the next path. Only then will you see where I've gone. Though I can't promise I'll be there once you turn up. I'm going someplace hot and steamy, so you'd better hurry to send me off! Anyways, good luck and farewell!! Hope you're a smart cookie, xoxo, Jane Doe <3.  </h3>
